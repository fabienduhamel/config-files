# My config files

## News

**Deprecated**: For a better conf management, this repo is now replaced with these following:

- Dotfiles moved to [dev-setup repo](https://github.com/fabienduhamel/dev-setup)
- Sublime conf moved to [sublime-conf repo](https://github.com/fabienduhamel/sublime-conf)

_Note_: The `linux_perso` env is now the only one useful for me - only for the display functions, despite my fixed
2-monitors configuration.

## How to use

Read the help by running:

`./config-files.sh -h`

## What you need

The linux environment is based on a debian-like distribution (Ubuntu / Mint).
To activate all features, run:

`./linux/setup.sh`

This will install common binaries and configure your system environment. Check it.
